Freelance web designer for front-end applications.

I'm an active and well-rounded person with attention to detail and a drive to solve issues permanently in consideration of long term solutions.
My passion for programming is a lifestyle that has empowered me to design products which connect good brands with their most passionate consumers.
I've grown up trying to understand the way things work but not how they should work.
Learning how to program has been an absolute joy and I hope you enjoy navigating this website.
My development practices and methodologies are well researched to ensure websites work on any device and subsequent provision of post-deployment support/maintenance.

Skills include: SEO, copywriting, content creation, community outreach, online marketing, and responsive web design.
